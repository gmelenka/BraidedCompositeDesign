Braided Composite Design application for mobile devices

This application was designed using Kivy (http://kivy.org/#home) to provide a cross-platform tool for the design and manufacture of braided composites.

The application was designed as a companion to the upcoming book: Handbook of Advances in 2D and 3D Braided Composite Materials: Theory, Production, Testing and Applications, Carey JP (Ed), Woodhead Publishing, 2016

The files can be run by downloading the latest version of Kivy and running the main.py file. The files can also be run on a mobile device using the KivyLauncher APP(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kivy.pygame&hl=en).
